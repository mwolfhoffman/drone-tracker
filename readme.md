This was my first independent project so that I could learn how to use AngularJS. 
I also tried out various data visualization libraries, ultimately deciding on D3js. 

Tech Used: 


-HTML5/CSS3

-Bootstrap

-AngularJS

-JavaScript

-jQuery

-nvD3

-angular-google-maps



This project allows users to search the drone strikes of the US Government from 2001 to Present in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen. 


There is also functionality for data visualization where I use Angular's version of D3, nvD3. 

I also use angular-google-maps which allows ng-directives to be used. I used this to place pins on all drone strikes recorded in the API. 



I make Ajax calls to the DroneSteam API, which follows REST.
